# BUCKET

## What's On Your Bucketlist?

Welcome to Bucket!

### What is Bucket?
Bucket is a way for users to keep track of their personal bucketlists! The program was initially written for Flatiron School's Rails Project requirement.

### User Guide
Upon creating a new account, users can create new Buckets for themselves, in which they keep keep track of their goals/aspirations.

### Future Plans
Future plans for Bucket include the adding the ability to share your buckets with friends, as well as collaborate on assembling/keeping track of said buckets. I also plan to add the ability to search for more information about your goals directly from the goal's show page.

### Installation Guide
- Clone repository
- Run `bundle install` to install all necessary gems
- Start up a rails server (`rails s`)
- Either create an account or login to your existing account
